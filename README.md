# Welcome to the developer humor repo

"What did I just walk into?" -- well, developers are a funny bunch. Just look at our 
Slack channels, commit logs, and secret Reddit accounts and you will see that
the lights are on (and some of us are home).

This is just a fun repo where developers can share their funny (but functional code).

I will provide examples as I find them or think of them. Please credit yourself or
the original creators in the comments at the top of the file.
